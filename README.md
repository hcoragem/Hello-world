# Hello-world
My first repository
#
This repository will be used for my first project for IoT using Python language.
In this project I will use the raspberry-pi as a gateway of many sensors to cloud servers such as AWS IoT.
First I will start with some python mqtt projects.

The raspberry pi used in this project is a raspberry pi 2 running Jessie  and connected to a protoboard 
with a button and two LEDs.
The code is commented and should be self explanatory.
